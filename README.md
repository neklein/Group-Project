# Group-Project

For this project, 4 of us worked together as a group utilizing Visual Studio 2017 and SQL Server to create a blog for a Sea Monster lover.

I specifically spent most of my time on:
<ul>
<li>Creating and editing the ADO methods to utilize the SQL stored procedures in a C# Repository in our Data Layer.</li>
<li>Testing the methods to verify that we could access the database and the information it stores.</li>
<li>Utilizing Data Annotations for security. I specifically used the IValidatable Object to override the Valide() method</li>
<li>Implementing an interface on the controllers using a factory class.</li>
</ul>
